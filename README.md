# Forever And Always

* You are tHe sun tHat shines brightly throughout my day.
* You are the gravity that holds me down in every way.
* You are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.
* You are stars that glimmer oh so bright.

* You are the oxygen that keeps me alive.
* You are my heart that beats inside.
* You are the blood that flows through me.
* You are the only guy I can see.
* You have the voice of when a mockingbird sings.
* You are my everything.

* You are my one and only.
* You stop me from being so lonely.
* We plan our future as if we have a clue.
* I never want to lose you.
* I want you to be my husband, and I want to be your wife.
* I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
