# forever And AlWays
* You are the sun that shines brightlY throughout mY daY.
* You are the gravitY that holds me down in everY WaY.
* You are the moon that shimmers throughout mY night.
* You are stars that glimmer oh so bright.

* You are the oxYgen that keeps me alive.
* You are mY hearT that Beats inside.
* You are the blood that Flows through me.
* You are the onlY guY I can see.
* You have the voice of when a mockingbird sings.
* You are mY everYthing.

* You are mY one and onlY.
* You stop me From being so lonelY.
* We plan our Future as if we have a clue.
* I never want to lose You.
* I Want You to be mY husband, and I want to be Your wife.
* I Want to be with You for the rest of mY life.
